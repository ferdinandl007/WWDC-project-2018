 ## Smilelefy The smile game 😁
 
 Smilelefy uses `SpriteKit`, `CIDetector` and `AVFoundation` to create a game where all you need is a smile! No hands are required throughout the game. I built this with accessibility in mind as I have a friend who is paraplegic. Therefore he cannot use his hands to interact so I came up with the solution for him to be able to play this game!
 # How to play!
 Use your Smile to change the colour of the ball. Also try to keep a neutral face if you are not planning to change the colour.
 The colour of the ball has to match the colour of the block its colliding with. To be able to remove it and gain 20 points. However if this is not the case the ball will bounce off and 10 points will be deducted.
 The goal of the game is to remove all blocks with the highest score possible.
