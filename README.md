 ## Smilelefy The smile game 😁
 
 Smilelefy uses `SpriteKit`, `CIDetector` and `AVFoundation` to create a game where all you need is a smile! No hands are required throughout the game. I built this with accessibility in mind as I have a friend who is paraplegic. Therefore he cannot use his hands to interact so I came up with the solution for him to be able to play this game!
